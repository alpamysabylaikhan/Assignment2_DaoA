# Min Heap Sort Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and implementation of **Min Heap Sort** for the *Design and Analysis of Algorithms* course.

## Overview
The project analyzes Min Heap Sort, a sorting algorithm that builds a heap and extracts the minimum element repeatedly to produce a descendingly sorted array. The report covers:

- Algorithm description  
- Time and space complexity analysis (O(n log n))  
- Code review and optimization suggestions  
- Empirical benchmark results
